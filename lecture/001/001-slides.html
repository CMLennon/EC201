 - .hi[Five Pillars of Economics]
 
--

.qa[Incentives] describe what causes individuals to make choices. These can be negative, positive, direct, or indirect.
 
--

.qa[Trade-offs] Every choice that is interesting features some benefits and some lost opportunities. These are tradeoffs.

--

.qa[Opportunity Cost] Every choice that features tradeoffs will have opportunity costs that come from giving up our next best alternative.

--

.qa[Thinking on the Margin] Every quantity choice really boils down to whether the next unit of that item makes the chooser better off or worse off.

--

.qa[Benefits from Specialization] The economy you know functions on a group of highly trained and specialized individuals working together and trading to create value.

# Economic Models

---
name: sl-classes
## Context

--

Economics in its modern form, is actually a .hi[fairly recent development] as far as the sciences are concerned.

--
Economists trace Economics back to Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations* written in 1776.orange[*]

.footnote[

.orange[*]The ideas in this book were originally developed by the Tunisian scholar, Ibn Khaldun in "The Muqaddimah" from 1337

]

--

Contextually, this means that many of the ideas in Economics arose at the same time as Darwinian thought, during the peak of Romanticism and nearly simulataneously with 'the scientific method.'

--

These ideas strongly influence how Economists think about how to solve problems, even today.

---
## The Scientific Method

Generally, the scientific method consists of:

- An observation (.qa[when I put my hand on the burner, it hurts!])

--

- A hypothesis (.qa[my hand hurts because the burner is hot!])

--

- Build a model (.qa[As temperature in the burner increases, my hand hurts more!])

--

- Test the model, usually with statistics (.qa[I will place my hand on the burner at a variety of temperatures])

--

- Refine the model based on observation (.qa[Only once the burner reaches a certain threshold do I begin to feel pain!])

---
name: sl-classes
## Economic Models

--
However, economists for the most part study things that can't be contained in a laboratory.

--

.qa[Ex.] How would we run an experiment on the effect of minimum wage on prices of food in grocery stores?

--

This means most economic theory is generated by waiting for the world to create .hi[natural experiments]

--

.qa[Ex.] Does an increase in Seattle's minimum wage to 15$ an hour cause prices in Seatle's grocery stores to increase? Evidence currently points to no.

# Economic Models

class: inverse, middle

## Economic Models

Coming up with answers to economic problems is inherently complex: the goal is to think about the outcome of how hundreds if not thousands of individual choices can cause changes in an economy.

--

The significance of these choices is equally massive: billions of humans every day are seriously impacted by even small shifts in prices and quantities.

--

In order to learn anything from these models, we need to .hi[simplify] our world so that we can understand each moving piece, one at a time.

--

The way Economists do this is by studying observed phenomenon in markets and choices .hi-orange[ceteris paribus]

---
## Ceteris Paribus

Ceteris Paribus is a term that means .hi[all else equal.]

--

In economics, social scientists use *ceteris paribus* to mean that, outside of the variables included in our model, our other variables aren't changing.

--

At first glance, this may seem counter-intuitive to you, but it's actually a very necessary assumption in order to understand how the economy.

---
## Example

I want you to imagine that you walk up to a control panel that looks like this:

&lt;img src="images/nuclear_silo.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.hi[but you knew nothing about it]
---
## Example

How do you go about figuring out what it does?

--

One option is to just turn a bunch of dials/push buttons all at once, and then when something happens, assume you turned the right dials.

--

However, you .hi[won't know] if it was the last button/dial alone that had the effect or some combination

--

The other option is to turn the dials/push the buttons one at a time/a few at a time, and record the results. This lets you isolate effects from specific buttons
---
## The Modeled Economy

Unfortunately, .hi-orange[markets] work without much economist interference, so instead, we have to create models to think about what happens when dials are turned on their own.

--

When we do this, we have to separate our variables (dials, from our example) into two categories:

--

- .hi-orange[Included variables] (endogenous, meaning having an internal cause)

--

- .hi[Excluded variables] (exogenous, meaning having an external cause)

---

## Assumptions

Because we don't live in a world that has easy laboratories for economics, we need to make reasonable assumptions about how humans will behave.

--

One such assumption is what variables we .hi-orange[choose to include] in a model

--

Another common assumption is that we will assume humans are .hi[rational creatures] and reasonably will try to maximize their benefits whenever they make choices.

--

This is a simplifying assumption, but is more robust to testing than it seems. At the end of the course, we'll explore how humans sometimes do not behave this way in real life.

--

Generally, in the history of economics however, this assumption has been fairly robust.

---

## Assumptions

Assumptions are one of the most important things to evaluate in a model - you should think about any economic model you see and ask yourself:

--

- .hi[Do I believe the assumptions here?]

--

 -.hi[What would happen if these assumptions were wrong?]

--

This is how economic models grow - by questioning the assumptions and building more complex and realistic models from them.

--

This is a simplifying assumption, but has proven to generate good predictions of behavior. At the end of the course, we'll explore how humans sometimes do not behave this way in real life.

--

In the history of economics however, this assumption has been fairly robust.

# Production Possibilities Frontier

---
class: inverse, middle
---
## PPF

So let's build our first economic model together. We're going to recreate a model that's used in a variety of economic fields.

--

We're going to make a .hi[production possibilities frontier (ppf)] model. This model describes what resources a person, firm or nation can produce using what tools, knowledge and abilities they might have available.

--

Remember .hi-orange[ceteris paribus]? 
--
We need to figure out what dials we want to remain steady so we can slowly add them back into our model.

--

we're going to assume that available tools, knowledge-bases and abilities stay fixed. This is common in economics, since at any moment in time, it's difficult to instantaneously materialize those things.
---

## PPF

To keep things simple, we're also going to set our model on a theoretical desert island with two stranded people and two 'goods' that can be produced with our resource: .hi-purple[time].

--

These goods are going to be .hi-orange[fish] and .hi[water]. We're just trying to survive here!

--

Let's say we have 10 hours a day we can be doing survival activities, there's some maximum amount of fish we can scavenge.

--

Similarly, there's some maximum amount of water we can gather in 10 hours.

---

## PPF

Of course, one assumption is that we can choose to gather .hi[less] fish or water on this island. 

--

Our assumption is that getting fewer resources takes .hi[less] time. Further, getting .hi-orange[more] resources, will take .hi-orange[more] time. This is true for both water and fish.

--

These assumptions seem reasonable, yes? 

--

This means is we're using all of our resources (time here) efficiently, there is some production frontier beyond which we cannot reach.

---

## PPF

Now - we're going to do our very first .hi-orange[graph.] Graphs are visual representations of models, and do a great job of letting you see all the moving parts at once.

--

First though, I'm going to review how .hi[graphs] work. You guys likely know this, but I want to be thorough.
