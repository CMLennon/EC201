# What is Economics?

## Definition

You've probably experienced a situation where you had to make a .hi-orange[choice] in which you had to make .hi[a tradeoff].

--

Maybe you had to pick whether to work a few extra hours at your job, or watch some TV on the couch, or go on a date, but you couldn't do all three.

--

How does an Uber driver decide when to .hi[stop] working? How does an Uber driver decide when to .hi-orange[start] working?

--

You may not know it, but you were unconciously solving .hi-orange[your own economic problem]!

--

.hi-slate[Book:] the study of how individuals and society allocate their .hi[limited resources] to satisfy their .hi-orange[unlimited wants] (Pg 6)

## What's different?

First off, I want to say .hi-purple[thank you] for bearing with the University as we sort out the online education approach.

--

That being said, I want to be sure that each of you leave with a .hi[thorough] understanding of Economics (or the opportunity to acquire it).

--

Because of the online format, I cannot reccommend you buy the book (Principles of Microeconomics (Mateer & Coppock 2e)) enough (the ebook is also fine.) You won't need it, but you'll probably do better with it. The more resources you have, the better.

## What's different?

Additionally, I'm going to give a larger focus than usual on assignments that develop understanding of the material.

--

.hi-orange[Grades] will be made up of performance across a midterm [30%], a final [35%] two types of homework assignments [30% in total, 15% each] and a writing assignment [5%].

--

There will be three types of 'homework' that I've customized for this course specifically: .hi[Inquizitive assessments], a writing assignment (we'll talk about this after the midterm) and .hi-slate[Smartwork] 'quizzes.'

--

.hi[Inquizitive:] a way to practice the material from the chapter.

--

.hi-slate[Smartwork:] a quiz-equivalent covering each chapter we will have.

---
name: different
## Inquizitive and smartwork assessments

.hi[Inquizitive] is a tool for you to self-assess your own understanding of the readings.

--

I could tell you about .hi[Inquizitive] and .hi-orange[Smartwork], but I think it's better if I just show you how they work.

--

before I switch to .hi[Inquizitive]/ .hi-orange[Smartwork], you should know that when you log in, you will be prompted to register for a Norton account.

If you use the registration code .hi-slate["community"] you'll get access to both of these tools for free.

#Coronavirus

## A note about Coronavirus

- I am going to try my hardest to keep my Coronavirus references to a minimum. We all get enough about Coronavirus as it is, 
--
however, using context-driven examples can sometimes help you understand the material better.

--

So, if I'm going to use an example related to the pandemic, I am going to put the following symbol at the top of the slide:

# Scarcity

---
## What makes a choice?

What makes a choice .hi[interesting]?

--

.qa[ex:] You want to buy a new outfit that costs 80*$*, and you want to go out with some friends to a music festival that costs 180*$*. You have 260 dollars to spend on these things, so you bought both and gave up nothing to do so.

--

.qa[ex:] You want to buy a new jacket or a new pair of jeans that are the same price, but you can only afford one of them. You buy the jeans.

--

.qa[ex:] You get invited to go on a trip to go to Florida for spring break, but it's your Grandma's 80th birthday. You decide to go to spring break.

--

Are these choices interesting? .hi[which ones?]


---

--

 - There really wasn't a choice here, was there? You had two choices, and you took both of them. These aren't the kind of choices we call .hi[interesting.]

.qa[ex:] You want to buy a new jacket or a new pair of jeans that are the same price, but you can only afford one of them. You buy the jeans.

--

This is more interesting! You got some of what you wanted, but not everything you wanted. Money, in this scenario, .hi-purple[is scarce]. 

--

.qa[def:] Scarcity, as used in microeconomics, is when individuals or groups of individuals want .hi-orange[more than they can have].

# Incentives

---
## More What?

Good question! .hi-orange[more anything]. 

--

In economics, we describe things that make individuals pick one option over another as .hi-orange[incentives.] This is known as the .hi[first pillar of economics]

--

If you're into politics, or like to read the news, you likely have heard the word 'incentive' before.

--

An article from last week describes how car manufacturers are offering .hi-orange[payment deferral incentives] for car payments...

--

*"Ford offers six months of payment relief for eligible new car customers who finance their purchases through Ford Credit. The company pays for the first three months, and customers can defer up to three more months..."*

---
## Incentives

What does the example on the last page .hi-orange[incentivize?]

--

If I was on the fence about buying a new Ford, I might be .hi-orange[more willing] to buy a car now that I won't have to pay for the first six months.

--

This is a classic example of a **positive incentive**.

--

A .hi[positive incentive] is anything that makes an individual .hi-orange[want to do something more.] 

--

By decreasing the cost of buying a car, buying a car has become .hi-orange[more attractive] so more individuals will want to do it.

---
## Incentives

Not all incentives are positive though, there are also **negative incentives.**

--

Imagine ... a poor student is told by their parents that they .hi-orange[better get good grades or else]... .hi[*]

.footnote[
.hi[*] This has been shown to not produce good results - for best results, incentivize activities the students have control over
]

--

This is an example of a **negative incentive**. 
--
The parents are making the student .hi[want to do something] they otherwise would not want to do by .hi-orange[changing the cost of *not* doing it]

--

A .hi[negative incentive] is anything that makes someone .hi[want to do something less]

---
## Incentives

The incentives we've covered so far are called .hi[direct incentives].

--

Do .hi[action] (*choice*) or .hi-orange[consequence] (*incentive*) is the "formula" for a direct incentive.
--
However, policies can have .hi[unintended consequences] by way of something called .hi-orange[indirect incentives]

--

Let's think about a more serious policy application:

--

.qa[Q:] What are some indirect impacts from having socialized healthcare, aka *medicare for all*

--

Let's snap our fingers and examine the United States with Medicare for All

---

Let's identify the .hi-orange[direct incentives] introduced through medicare for all.

--

.pull-left[
- Sick people are .hi-orange[more likely] to get treatment

- Checkups are cheaper! This likely means there are .hi-orange[likely fewer] ER admits

- More costly for medical companies to conspire (?) with insurance carriers to drive up prices.
]

--

.pull-right[
- I probably am now .hi[more willing] to do things that might get me sick or injured

- That means other people are now .hi[more likely] to get sick or injured

]

These things in .hi[pink] are called .hi[indirect incentives]

---
layout: true
# Positive vs. Normative

---

Notice, on the last slide, I didn't try to **pass judgement** on the policy overall.

--

I simply identified what types of impacts we could potentially see.

--

If I had said **We should enact medicare for all** and you disagreed with me, how would we find out which one of us was right? (I'm .hi[always] right)

--

.qa[The reality:] we couldn't. 
--
That's because *We should enact medicare for all* is a .hi[normative] statement.
---
## Normative statements

.hi[Normative] statements are statements which can't be tested.

--

- Normally, these statements that reflect a .hi[value judgement].

--

The opposite of a normative statement is a .hi-orange[positive statement].

---
## Positive statements

.hi-orange[Positive] statements are statements which **can** be tested.

--

We .hi-orange[could test] to see if, after passing medicare for all, more patients got treatment, or if we saw fewer ER visits.

--

We could not test if medicare for all was a .hi[great policy].

---
## Positive vs. Normative

As a test, let's see if we can find out which of the below is .hi-orange[positive] or .hi[normative]

--

.pull_left[
- Giving everyone 1000$ is a great policy

- Lowering interest rates will lead to an increase in defaults

- Board games are really fun.
]

.pull_right[
- You need to excercise.

- Introducing affirmative action will lead to more equity.

]

Just because a statement is .hi-orange[positive] doesn't necessarily mean it's **correct**.

# Tradeoffs

---

## Why Scarcity

You may ask yourself though, why do we care about scarcity? (Aside from choices withoutt scarcity is kind of boring)

--

- We care about scarcity, because .hi[scarcity] implies .hi-orange[tradeoffs]

--

One cost we haven't talked about yet is actually one of the most precious and scarce: 
--
.hi[time].

--

Even if .hi[everything in the world were free], you .hi-orange[still wouldn't be able to do it all.]

--

The existance of .hi-orange[tradeoffs] also means we have to think about the cost of choices a little more carefully

---

# Opportunity Costs

layout: true
# Opportunity Costs

---

Making a choice is .hi[interesting] economically because choices .hi-orange[cost] something. You're probably pretty familiar with 'costs.'

--

When you pay rent, you are giving up a lot of potenial income to live somewhere.

--

However, you also .hi-purple[give up being able to live somewhere else.]

--

In economics, we call this .hi-purple[opportunity cost], or the lost benefit of receiving the next best alternative.

---

## Assumption Alert!

--

- In general, economics assumes that individuals are able to identify and choose from a .hi[menu of options], their .hi-purple[best possible choice]. 

--

- What makes a choice best for an individual is that it is the option the individual .hi[believes] to be best. That is, people don't have to see the future, they just act in their own self-interest with the information they have.

--

- Further, economics also assumes that individuals have beliefs about what their .hi-orange[next best option] is.

---

## Tradeoffs in Everything

Let's use a simple example, choosing what to eat for dinner. For now, we can only pick one option.

--

.pull-left[
.hi[Pizza]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/flyingsquirrelpiz.jpg')
```
]

.pull-right[
.hi-orange[Salmon]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/salm.png')
```
]

Let's say the .hi[pizza] costs me 29.00 and the .hi-orange[salmon] costs me 40.00

---

If I'm willing to pay 30.00 for the pizza, and 40.00 for the salmon, and I choose to buy the pizza...

--

- The price of the pizza is 29.00. This is sometimes referred to as the **accounting cost** of the pizza

--

- The .hi[opportunity cost] of the pizza is 40.00, if I can only pick one food and my next best option was the salmon.

--

- The .hi-purple[total cost] of the pizza then, is the amount paid (29.00) plus the opportunity cost (40.00) = (69.00).

# Thinking on the Margin

---

## Evaluating Options

Most choices in life, however, aren't .hi[binary] like .hi[pizza or salmon.]

--

- Most things are chosen by intensity, ie, choosing to do .hi[more] or .hi-purple[less] of a given thing.

--

- When you are deciding to drink beers and watch Netflix over studying, you probably have still done .hi[some of each]. 

--

- If you've already studied 6 hours today, you probably aren't going to get much out of studying for that 7th hour.

--

- Similarly, if you've watched all the good shows on Netflix already, and you've had 3 beers so far, watching Netflix just isn't going to seem as good of an option.

---

## Evaluating Options

Thus it makes sense that individuals make choices .hi[on the margin], that is, they make decisions based on how much benefit they get from the .hi-purple[next unit] of something.

--

When my partner and I are preparing to have people come over, why do I throw an embarassing amount of stuff in my closet?

--

I could clean up properly, but cleaning takes .hi-orange[time.] 
--
Therefore likely going to do the bit of cleaning that I value most .hi[first]. I'll likely clean the thing that makes my place look tidiest .hi[first].

---

## Evaluating Options

The .hi[marginal benefit] of cleaning the obvious things is very high.

--

The .hi[marginal cost] also matters: I probably won't re-carpet my living room on a whim, even if it would make my house look better.

--

This means I'll likely do the .hi[easiest/least costly] and .hi-orange[most effective/most beneficial] things first.

---

Imagine a farmer with .hi[4 bags of wheat]

--

With the .hi-orange[first bag of wheat] the farmer will make bread to survive.

--

With the .hi-purple[second bag of wheat] the farmer will make bread for his animals to eat

--

With the .hi[third bag of wheat] the farmer will make whiskey to sell at the market

--

With the .hi-slate[last bag] the farmer will make bread to feed the pigeons.
---

Imagine a farmer with .hi[4 bags of wheat], but now, he loses 1 bag of wheat. 

.hi[What does the farmer do now?]

The farmer probably .hi-orange[stops feeding the pigeons] rather than reduce every activity by 1/4.

--

.hi-slate[Why is that?] 
--

.hi[The feeding of the pigeons] provides that farmer with the lowest marginal benefit.
---

## Evaluating Options

The easiest way to think about the effects of this is two-fold:

--

.pull_left[
.hi[your first slice of cake]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/hapbab.png')
```
]

.pull_right[
.hi[your last slice of cake]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/sadbaby.jpeg')
```
]

---

## Evaluating Options

The easiest way to think about the effects of this is two-fold:

--
 .pull_left[
.hi[your first hour of studying]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/firsthour.jpeg')
```
]

.pull_right[
.hi[your 9th hour of studying]
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lasthour.jpeg')
```
]

In short, people will tend to do the things until the point that the .hi[marginal cost] has exceeded the .hi-orange[marginal benefit]. 
--
If you remember nothing else from this lecture, .hi[REMEMBER THAT].

# Specialization
---
layout: true
# Specialization

---

How much of the stuff you use on a regular basis did you *personally* make?

--

You are working on a computer right now to watch this video, that was likely made by a company.

--

Even more than that, a lot of the parts in your computer are made by a lot of .hi-orange[different places].

--

The reason for this is that an economy fundamentally functions through the exchange of goods and services.

---

## Gains from "Trade"

For micro-economics, it probably doesn't make a lot of sense to study .hi[trade] as you normally think of it. 
--
However, trade between individuals and firms is an .hi-purple[integral] part of the modern day economy.

--

To prove it to you, I want to turn to one of the most miraculous objects in the modern day economy: 
--
.hi[the pencil.] It might surprise you to know this kind of pencil has only been around since the 1860s.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pencil.png')
```

---

Maybe you're weird like me, but I imagine most of you have never thought about how a pencil is actually made.

--

Let's .hi[make a pencil.]

--

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/pencils.jpg')
```

--

Perfect! Now we need to make an eraser. What are erasers made out of?

---

These days, erasers are made out of .hi[Oil] and .hi-orange[pumice.]

--

Great. We just need to learn organic chemistry, maybe a little metalurgy to make that aluminum ring, some geology so we can locate a solid pumice supply and...

--

Why do all of this? I can go on Amazon right now and buy 150 #2 pencils for 12.50.

--

Would you rather spend ALL that effort to make your own pencil when you could simply buy some? 
--
Follow up question: Why is the pencil so cheap?

--

Because people and firms have .hi[specialized] in making each little piece of the pencil.

---

## Trade Creates Value

Trading between people and firms in an economy inherently creates value, because each of us can .hi[specialize] in what we're best .orange[*] at

.footnote[
.orange[*]: Not necessarily best, we'll learn about this soon
]

--

Even though .hi[you] don't find it worth it to go through the effort of making your own pencil, .hi-purple[someone does]. Because they do, you can give them money and they'll give you a pencil.

--

That's a .hi[win win] because for someone willing to pay at least 3.00 for 50 pencils, and a firm that can make those pencils for 2.50, trading pencils for money can make everyone better off.
---
## Trade Creates Value

If the .hi[best] person at making pencils doesn't make my pencil, than who does?

--

The answer is in that low-price we saw on Amazon - someone's .hi-orange[opportunity cost] of gathering materials and making 150 pencils to sell them to you is .hi-purple[super low]. 
--
2.50 to be exact.

--

On Wednesday, we'll talk a bit more about this, but I wanted to set the idea up ahead of time.

---

## Trade Creates Value

Let's do a simpler example - you have a bike you bought 4 years ago for 400 dollars. You're thinking of selling it, and you'd be willing to sell it now for 250 dollars.

--

Your friend, Jamie, really wants a bike. They'd be willing to buy your bike for 300 dollars.

--

They offer to buy your bike for 275 dollars, and you accept, since it's more than your .hi[willingness to pay] of 250.

--

By having the option to trade, the bike has increased in value since Jamie values the bike at 300 dollars, whereas you only valued it at 250.

---
## Trade Creates Value

This process is repeated to create economies. When you work, you are exchanging your time and talents for money, which you in turn use to buy stuff.

# The Five Pillars of Economics

---

This lays out the .hi[five pillars of economics]. Though this is the first lecture, almost all of our future lectures will in some way .hi-orange[tie back] to these core concepts. In total, the pillars are...

.pull_left[
- Incentives: What makes us choose what we do

- Trade-offs: How we evaluate our options

- Opportuniy Cost: The cost of our next best alternative

# Some examples

Let's test our knowledge:

.qa[1)] Todd want to go camping with some friends at Sand Dune national park over the summer.

Let's test our knowledge:

.qa[2)] Marissa was also invited on this trip.
--
Marissa would LOVE to go camping for a week over the summer, but she works full-time at a coffee shop for 15 dollars an hour. If she went, she wouldn't be able to afford her rent, and she'd rather have a place to live.
--

.qa[What pillar best represents Marissa's choice?]

--

.qa[A] Opportunity Cost

---

Let's test our knowledge:

.qa[3)] The last member of the group, Donald, set up this trip. 
--
Donald obviously wants to go on this trip. However, he's not that experienced at camping, but owns a gigantic tent that he can bring along. Though he'd love to go camping, Donald would have a hard time doing all the work to go camping by himself, so decides to just cancel the trip.
